### Since v1.2.2 (Unreleased):
- Migration toward `lmfit`:
  - `lmfit` now runs by default; set `QSOFITMORE_USE_LMFIT=false` (or adjust `migration_config`) to opt into the legacy `kmpfit` backend when Kapteyn is installed.
  - `lmfit` is now a core dependency; Kapteyn `kmpfit` is optional via the `legacy` extra.
  - New runtime feature flags in `qsofitmore.config.migration_config` to enable `lmfit` pathways gradually and/or validate against `kmpfit` (via env vars and tox envs).
  - Implemented `lmfit`-based continuum and experimental line-fitting paths behind flags; more robust broken PL; simplified bounds; always include error columns even when `MC=False`; fixed Fe II MC collection for `cal_Fe_line_res`.
- Pixel rejection now relies solely on explicit masks (`and_mask`, `or_mask`, `wave_mask`); the automatic `_RejectBadPix` outlier filter has been removed to preserve emission-line peaks.
- Monte Carlo line fitting now runs via `lmfit` when that backend is active, and MC-derived parameter/metric errors are saved whenever `MC=True`.
- Linear-axis fits now classify narrow/broad components using a 509.6 km/s sigma threshold (matching the legacy 0.0017 ln-lambda cut), ensuring `cal_na_line_res` reports the correct component type.
- MBH utilities: added instrumental FWHM correction and support for runs without uncertainty inputs.
- Plotting and QA: minor y-axis label tweaks and small plotting improvements.
- CI/dev: modernized tox matrix, optional Kapteyn install for legacy envs, and various maintenance fixes.

### Updates from v1.2.1 to v1.2.2:
- Added the Garcia-Rissmann et al. (2012) Fe II template within [8100, 11500] Å (NIR).
- Added `set_pl_pivot()` to configure the power-law continuum pivot wavelength.
- Expanded NIR continuum windows; unified iron template handling (`include_iron`); refined Verner (2009) template upper wavelength to 1 micron; improved V09 FWHM handling.
- API cleanups and utilities: renamed `Flux2L` to `flux_to_luminosity`; minor result/table name updates; updated tutorial and examples.
- Documentation and metadata: updated citation (Zenodo DOI), README, and packaging metadata.

### Updates from v1.2.0 to v1.2.1:
- Added the Verner et al. (2009) Fe II template (UV–optical; up to 1 micron) for iron emission fitting.
- Added Storey & Hummer (1995) Balmer emission line series templates (n_upper=6–50) for N_e=1e9 and 1e10; integrated with the Balmer continuum.
- Added convenience initializer `QSOFitNew.fromsdss()`; improved `fromiraf()`; new `in_rest_frame` argument for `QSOFitNew`.
- Switched Galactic extinction to use `dustmaps` by default; added Planck maps (`planck16`/`planck` and `planck14`) in addition to SFD98; default map set to Planck GNILC (2016).
- Added Fe II flux and EW measurements in a user-defined range via `Fe_flux_range`, saved to outputs; adjusted default Fe II flux window to [4434, 4684] Å.
- Removed the external `PyQSOFit` submodule by merging core functionality into `fitmodule.py`; `qsofitmore` is now a standalone package with the same GNU license as `PyQSOFit`.
- Packaging and maintenance: included package data, added `pyproject.toml`, addressed deprecations/warnings, and updated examples/docs.

### Updates from v1.1.0 to v1.2.0:
- `PyQSOFit` is now included as a submodule. 
- The installation process is simplified by adding the dependencies `sfdmap`, `PyAstronomy`, and `uncertainties` to `setup.py`, and by adding `PyQSOFit` to `requirements.txt`. 

### Updates from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0:
- Added an optional broken power-law model in the continuum fitting process.  
- Enabled line property outputs for all narrow lines, OIII core+wing as a whole, and CIV br+na as a whole.  
- Used new criterion to verify narrow/broad components in self._PlotFig() to prevent narrow components from being plotted as red (broad) lines.  
- Changed prefix of comp_result from number to the complex name.  
- Bug fixes.
